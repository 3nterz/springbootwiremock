# Local Environment Setup of Tomcat and Sprint Boot App with Embedded Wiremock (HTTP & HTTPS)

## Background information

This Spring based project contains code to demonstrate the use of Embedded Wiremock with configuration for recording mapping files from both HTTP and HTTPS target URLs and setting up appropriate keystores and truststores to establish what SSL certificate is seen when accessing the URL through wiremock and also what SSL certificates can be trusted by the wiremock server.

This code in this project provides a WAR file that can be deployed into a Apache Tomcat Server. The WAR file when deployed, programmatically starts wiremock server, and starts recording mode targeting a HTTP URL first, and calls this HTTP endpoint through Wiremock server, using RestAssured framework, in order to automatically generate the mapping files for the HTTP endpoint. The code then stops recording mode for the HTTP endpoint and resets the wiremock cache in order to move on to recording mapping files for a HTTPS URL. This HTTPS URL will be called through Wiremock server, using RestAssured framework configured with truststores and also Oauth 2 authentication.

# Getting Started

## Download and install JDK 8

![alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/3/30/Java_programming_language_logo.svg/234px-Java_programming_language_logo.svg.png "Logo")

* Go to the Oracle website to download the JDK. At time of writing instructions were available here on the Oracle website: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/install/windows_jdk_install.html#CHDEBCCJ
* Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the folder the JDK was installed at. For example in Windows running the command `echo %JAVAHOME%` may return `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_191`

## Download, extract and install Apache Maven 3.x
